# rrule_generator

RRuleGenerator is a widget for generating recurrence rules, such as described
in [the iCalendar RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5545)

This widget is based on the [rrule](https://pub.dev/packages/rrule) and [teno_rrule](https://pub.dev/packages/teno_rrule) packages.

The widget is actively used in the [Calendar Clock](https://calendarclock.app) app.
